if the game is simultaneous thent the function 'moveable_position' must be updated 

note that the functions in the info class are public for now. these functions can read and write to stdin,stdout.since the user gets an object of this class he might perform illegal input/output operations. What should we do about this? 

the map is taken to be a square? why?

direction constants must be made single integers. atleast in the user side
