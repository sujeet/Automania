note that the functions in the info class are public for now. these functions can read and write to stdin,stdout.since the user gets an object of this class he might perform illegal input/output operations. What should we do about this? 

the map is taken to be a square? why?

'initialize(x,y)' function must be added to Position class

'_validate_position' class must be changed to return something to represent illegal position rather than raising an exception.

moveable_position( Position ) function must be added to the map class which can test whether the current position is valid and if so is a non wall and trail position

direction constants must be made single integers.
